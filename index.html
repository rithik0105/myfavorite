        <p>My favorite cricket player is SachinTendulkar. During my farewell I was also honored with a certificate to appraise my contribution to my school cricket team. My cricket skills helped me to flatter Susain (my first girlfriend) when I was 20 years old. Later when I was 22 years old I became a part of Vishvya Bhartiya Vidya Sansthan & represented my teams in several tournaments.

But unfortunately we didn’t achieved much. I was disheartened and then Susain too left me because she dint find me her hero anymore. She thought I am a big looser. Later I took training from Sir Josheph. He taught me so many minute things and trained me to play perfectly. Today I am a member of Nitya Nanayang Polytechnic team. I am proud to be a part of this team.

Our team is gradually growing day by day. We are playing many cricket matches at national level. My aim is to play internationally.</p>

        <h1>Mahendra Singh Dhoni (About this soundpronunciation (help·info) born 7 July 1981), is a former Indian international cricketer who captained the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. Under his captaincy, India won the inaugural 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. A right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, Dhoni is one of the highest run scorers in One Day Internationals (ODIs) with more than 10,000 runs scored and is considered an effective "finisher" in limited-overs formats.[2][3][4] He is widely regarded as one of the greatest wicket-keeper batsmen and captains in the history of the game.[5] He was also the first wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings in ODI cricket.[6]

Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka. He has been the recipient of many awards, including the ICC ODI Player of the Year award in 2008 and 2009 (the first player to win the award twice), the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 2007, the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour, in 2009 and the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour, in 2018.[7] Dhoni was named as the captain of the ICC World Test XI in 2009, 2010 and 2013. He has also been selected a record 8 times in ICC World ODI XI teams, 5 times as captain. The Indian Territorial Army conferred the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel[8] to Dhoni on 1 November 2011. He is the second Indian cricketer after Kapil Dev to receive this honour.</h1>
